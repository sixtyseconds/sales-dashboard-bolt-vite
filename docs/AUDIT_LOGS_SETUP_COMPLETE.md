# âœ… Audit Logs Setup Complete

## What's Been Done

### 1. **Database Migration Created**
- File: `/supabase/migrations/20250102_create_audit_logs.sql`
- Manual SQL file: `/scripts/manual-run-audit-logs.sql`

### 2. **Application Code Added**
- âœ… **Audit Logs Hook**: `/src/lib/hooks/useAuditLogs.ts`
- âœ… **Admin UI Page**: `/src/pages/admin/AuditLogs.tsx`
- âœ… **Reusable Viewer**: `/src/components/admin/AuditLogViewer.tsx`

### 3. **Navigation Updated**
- âœ… **Route Added**: `/admin/audit-logs` in App.tsx
- âœ… **Menu Item Added**: Under Admin â†’ Audit Logs (with Shield icon)

## To Complete Setup

Since the Supabase CLI is having authentication issues, please run the migration manually:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: SQL Editor â†’ New Query

2. **Copy and run the SQL from**:
   `/scripts/manual-run-audit-logs.sql`

3. **Verify Setup**
   You should see:
   - "Audit logs table created successfully!"
   - A list of created triggers

## How to Access

1. **Login as an Admin**
2. **Navigate to**: Admin â†’ Audit Logs
3. **You'll see**:
   - Full audit trail of all changes
   - Filters for table, action, and date
   - Expandable rows showing exact field changes

## What Gets Tracked

From now on, ALL changes to these tables are tracked:
- âœ… **activities** (including meeting types!)
- âœ… **deals**
- âœ… **contacts**
- âœ… **companies**
- âœ… **tasks**

## Benefits

1. **No More Data Loss**: Every change is recorded permanently
2. **Meeting Type History**: Can see original values before they were changed
3. **User Accountability**: Know who changed what and when
4. **Easy Recovery**: Original values preserved in old_data field

## Example: Finding Original Meeting Types

Once the migration is run, you can use this query to find meeting type changes:

```sql
SELECT 
    changed_at,
    old_data->>'details' as original_meeting_type,
    new_data->>'details' as new_meeting_type,
    record_id
FROM audit_logs
WHERE table_name = 'activities'
    AND 'details' = ANY(changed_fields)
    AND old_data->>'details' != new_data->>'details'
ORDER BY changed_at DESC;
```

## Status: Ready to Deploy! ðŸš€

Just run the SQL migration and your audit logging system will be fully operational!
